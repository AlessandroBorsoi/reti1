## Laboratorio

Run `make` to compile both the client and the server. The binaries will be generated in the `bin` directory. 

Run `./bin/server <port_number>` and `./bin/client <server_address> <port_number>` from the root of the project to run the two applications.

Run `make clean` to remove the bin directory.
