Run `make all` to compile both the client and the server. The binaries will be generated in the `apps` directory. 

Run `./apps/server <port_number>` and `./apps/client <server_address> <port_number>` from the root of the project to run the two applications.

Run `make clean` to clean all generated files in all the directories.
